* ## Fist project of the course. Most of the work will be done by hand. But not recommended for the production use.
	* React and express will be used for three main goals.
	* React for client App, express for posts and comments routing and data fetching.
	* `npm init -y` initialises a directory with a **?node project** and inside it **package.json** file can be generated to bootstrap the project. `npm init -y` actually creates a base package.json file.
	* The same above process will be done for **posts** and **comments** directories.
	* [Postman.com](https://www.postman.com) is used as an API client to test each service manually while building them.
